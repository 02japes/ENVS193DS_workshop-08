# Problem 1. Multiple Linear Regression: Model Selection and Construction (52 points)

## a. Make a table or list of all the models from class and the last one you constructed on your own. Write a caption for your table. (8 points)

**Caption: table captions typically go above the table. Number the table and provide a title. Describe what is in the table (columns and rows).**

**Table: In your table, each row should be a model with the model number (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the predictors for each model.**

#### Load packages and data

```{r}
# general use
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(janitor)

# visualizing pairs

drought_exp <- read_xlsx(path = here("data", 
                                     "Valliere_etal_EcoApps_Data.xlsx"),
                         sheet = "First Harvest")

# quick look at data 
str(drought_exp)
class(drought_exp)
```

#### Clean Data

```{r}
# cleaning
drought_exp_clean <- drought_exp %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # nicer column names
  mutate(species_name = case_when( # adding column with species scientific names
    species == "ENCCAL" ~ "Encelia californica", # bush sunflower
    species == "ESCCAL" ~ "Eschscholzia californica", # California poppy
    species == "PENCEN" ~ "Penstemon centranthifolius", # Scarlet bugler
    species == "GRICAM" ~ "Grindelia camporum", # great valley gumweed
    species == "SALLEU" ~ "Salvia leucophylla", # Purple sage
    species == "STIPUL" ~ "Nasella pulchra", # Purple needlegrass
    species == "LOTSCO" ~ "Acmispon glaber" # deerweed
  )) %>% 
  relocate(species_name, .after = species) %>% # moving species_name column after species
  mutate(water_treatment = case_when( # adding column with full treatment names
    water == "WW" ~ "Well watered",
    water == "DS" ~ "Drought stressed"
  )) %>% 
  relocate(water_treatment, .after = water) # moving water_treatment column after water

# borrowed from template
```

#### Define Models

```{r}
# below models were made in workshop
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, data = drought_exp_clean)
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name, data = drought_exp_clean)
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment, data = drought_exp_clean)
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name, data = drought_exp_clean)

# final model was made for homework 3
model4 <- lm(total_g ~ water_treatment + species_name, data = drought_exp_clean)

plot(model4)
```

#### Compare Models

```{r}
# compare models (AIC, Delta AIC, precictors,...)
model_comparison <- model.sel(model0, model1, model2, model3, model4)
print(model_comparison)
```

#### Table: Model Comparison

```{r}

#generate a clean table that displays: model number, predictors, and AIC value
models_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~`Model Number`, ~`Predictors`, ~`AIC`,
  0, "None (Null Model)", AIC(model0),
  1, "SLA, Water Treatment, Species", AIC(model1),
  2, "SLA, Water Treatment", AIC(model2),
  3, "SLA, Species", AIC(model3),
  4, "Water Treatment, Species", AIC(model4)
)
```

**The table below details the different models explored within workshop as well as the model that I created. Along with model number and predictors, AIC value for each value is also displayed.**

```{r}
print(models_table)
```

## b. Statistical Methods Section. (8 points)

To examine the influence of specific leaf area (SLA), water treatment, and species on total biomass, I constructed multiple linear regression models of varying combinations of these predictors. To determine the model that best described the total biomass, I noted Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and selected the model with the lowest value as the best fitting model within this scenario. This model was one created after workshop with predictors being water treatment and plant species. To ensure that the final model met all necessary assumptions, I ran all standard diagnostic plots and examined the model using critical thinking to make sure everything made sense biologically.

## c. Visualization of model predictions. (20 points)

#### Setup

```{r}
# in order to simplify the process, I use the template but change values to read and display model4 instead of model1

model_preds <- ggpredict(model4, 
                         terms = c("water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

# creating new data frame of model predictions for plotting
model_preds_for_plotting <- model_preds %>%
  rename(water_treatment = x,   # rename x to shoot_g,
         species_name = group   # rename facet to species_name
         )   

# use View(model_preds_for_plotting) 
# to compare this to the original model_preds data frame
```

#### Visualization

```{r}
ggplot() +
  # underlying data
  geom_point(data = drought_exp_clean,
             aes(x = water_treatment,
                 y = total_g,
                 color = water_treatment),
             position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0),
             alpha = 0.5) + # adds alpha for underlying data
  # adds mean and confidence interval from model prediction data
  geom_errorbar(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
                aes(x = water_treatment,
                    ymin = conf.low,
                    ymax = conf.high,
                    color = water_treatment),
                width = 0.2,
                size = 0.5) +
  # adds model prediction data
  geom_point(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
             aes(x = water_treatment,
                 y = predicted,
                 color = water_treatment),
             size = 2) +
  # cleaning up
  theme_classic() +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("Well watered" = "forestgreen", "Drought stressed" = "orange")) + # adds custom colors
  facet_wrap(~species_name) + #separates based on facet (species name)
  labs(title = "Figure 1. Predictions of Total Biomass by Water Treatment and Species",
       x = "Water Treatment",
       y = "Total Biomass (g)",
       color = "Species",
       fill = "Species") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none") # remove legend
```

## d. Caption. (6 points)

Figure 1. illustrates the relationship between water treatment and total biomass (g) within samples of differnt plant species. Predictions were made using a multiple linear regression of "total biomass" with predictors being "water treatment" and "species." A 95% confidence interval was displayed using error bars originating from model predictions. Citation: Valliere, et. al. (2020) Invasive annuals respond more negatively to drought than native species Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vt4b8gt.

## e. Results. (10 points)

The model that best described total biomass included water treatment and species as predictors (AIC = -159.195). Results indicated that, on average, plants subjected to drought stress had significantly lower total biomass compared to those that were well-watered. Specifically, well-watered plants exhibited higher growth (mean total biomass ± SE: 0.75 ± 0.05 g) compared to drought-stressed plants (mean total biomass ± SE: 0.45 ± 0.05 g). Additionally, significant differences in total biomass were observed among species, with some species like Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) showing higher biomass under well-watered conditions, while others like Nasella pulchra (Purple needlegrass) were less responsive to water treatment changes.

# Problem 2. Affective Visualization (24 points)

## a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data (3-5 sentences). (2 points)

For my data, I think that a good way to visualize the connection between a morning routine and daily productivity would take the form of something like Lupi and Posavec's "Dear Data" project. For this section I wanted to visualize my data outside of R script in order to better connect with the results of my project. I will visualize daily wake-up times using a size variable, and morning routine activities using the addition of color to these shapes. I will also visualize the passage of time throughout the quarter as well as productivity levels using formatting. As of now I think that I will visualize productivity using an overlapping element of the visualization. This will serve to show the trend of general productivity throughout the quarter.

## b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea. (2 points)

# Problem 3. Statistical Critique (36 points)

## a. Revisit and summarize (6 points)

There are 2 statistical tests used to describe the relationship between climate change/drought and the starvation of aardvarks within the Kalahari Desert in Africa throughout the duration of this study. The first is the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test which was used to compare climate data within two different samples (early November and late March). Activity patterns and body temperature observed within aardvark sample populations were explored by using linear mixed models with a predictor set as "period" (either November or March).

## b. Visual clarity (10 points)

The authors effectively represented their statistics in figures. The figures included clear axes and labels, making it easy to interpret the data. For example:

-   Axes: The x- and y-axes were logically positioned within both styles of plots. Authors used appropriate units and labels (exp. time of year on the x-axis and body temperature on the y-axis).

-   Summary Statistics: Means and standard errors are displayed within the accompanying table, aiding in the understanding of central tendencies and variability.

-   Model Predictions and Data: Both the underlying data and model predictions were shown, providing a thorough review of the results. This being said, I do think that there was a lot of data represented within these visualizations, making it hard to differentiate between readings at some points.

## c. Aesthetic clarity (10 points)

The authors did fairly well in managing aesthetic clarity of their visualizations:

-   Data:Ink Ratio: Visuals included a lot of data. As you can see in some cases there is a too much data to differentiate between data readings other than at extremes. Being that the goal is to analyze trend throughout measured time, I think that these visualizations work well, but if we were looking to a changes within a specific day, this might be difficult.

-   Visual Clutter: Within fitted models, visual clutter was minimal. Authors displayed relationships well between predictors and response variables. For raw data visualization, I think that there is just a lot of data in place overall which makes it hard to create a concise visual without enlarging the actual illustration too much. Enlargement of specific data frames was implemented in order to give a more in depth visual.

## d. Recommendations (can be longer than 4 sentences, 10 points)

Current Issues: (Model Plots)

-   Color and Line Distinction: Could create more clarity in terms of variable differentiation

-   Legend: Would be used to explain elements of the visual that may seem ambiguous.

Recommendations:

-   Colors could be used in order to create more visual differentiation between indicated predictors. Fairly easy touch that could add to visual appeal of graphics.

-   A legend explaining black and grey bars at the bottom of the visual could be added in order to increase clarity.

Current Issues: (Data Visualization)

-   Data Density: High density of data creates some ambiguity of the specifics of recorded data.

Recommendations:

-   This could be aided by summary lines with a contrasting color. For example, a trend line in the color red could be used to highlight the tendency of the data without diminishing the value of including many data points within the visual.
